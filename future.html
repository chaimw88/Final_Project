                 <p id="p1">To me, the ideal course should start with setting up a decent development environment. 
                This should also include learning the basics of Git(hub) and using the terminal during coding.
                Although using Plunker has a lot of advantages, it's limits are easily reached and I think it stands
                in the way of what we're really here to do: write code and make stuff.
                After that, the first homework should consist of following a number of selected online courses. 
                For example, learning how to use JavaScript, jQuery and JSON to build interactive websites.
                In class, we can then discuss the difficulties everyone has encountered and try to clear everything
                up. As everyone has now worked with a few languages, each should think of his or her dream project, 
                and discuss in class if these projects would be feasible. Also, hints on what to learn in order to 
                begin with the project should be given. Every following class should be a session in which everyone 
                can work on their project, ask questions, and get guidance. At the end of the course, everyone should
                present their projects, after which we'll all have a drink at Caf√© van Zuylen, right around the corner. 
                Rumour has it that they have the best bitterballs in town.</p>

                <h1>The resources one needs to find</h1>
                <p id="p2">As mentioned above, we should make use of free online courses in order to get familiar with 
                a few different languages. Codecademy, codeschool, tuts+, etc. are great ways of getting familiar
                with coding and see immediate results on the output screen. The book of Haverbeke is a useful additional
                source, especially when everyone starts working on their own projects.</p>

                <h1>The tasks one needs to finish</h1>
                <p id="p1">The task consists of different parts. First of all, all the students should start researching on what a cookie is, 
                what is does and how is it made. You should start looking below at the different resources in order to really 
               Doing this, wil make comprehension of the cookie a lot easier and making one more fun. The second step consists of  making a coockie of your own.
               After this, a program needs to be made in order to process all incoming information. Students shoudl think of different categories. The next and final step 
               is showing a profile of the person's cookie. It would also be nice if in some way there could be a program where you can generate a profile of somebody else.

                <p id="p2">Please take the time to analyse and read the different resources listed below.
                I expect you to familiarize yourself with the different codes and how a cookie actually works. Also think about the possibilities of cookies.</p>
